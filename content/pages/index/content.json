It allows data scientists, data consumers and data providers, like cities, mobility service providers and automotive companies to share, collaborate and commercialize their data services. In a secure and privacy friendly manner and ensuring that data owners stay in full control over their data\n\nThe Future Mobility Data Marketplace is based on the Gaia-X concepts. Gaia-X is part of the “Digital Europe” program aiming at making Europe's digital infrastructure future proof and self-sovereign."
